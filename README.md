## Generate PWA Necessary Images ##
Every time I develop a new web application I need to resize and build several version of an image.
So I decide to develop an tool to help me do this job.
Touch Maker is an open source and small tool to generate all the necessary images for a PWA app base on one source image
I shared it on my GitHub account
